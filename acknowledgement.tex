I would like to express my gratitude towards my consultant, \emph{\vikkonzulens} and \emph{Recski G\'abor} who helped me tremendously through this project.

I would also like to thank my boyfriend, \emph{Szab\'o Roland} for his love, help and support. Without his kind words and supportive attitude I wouldn't have been able to achieve this.

My family was absolutely supportive and loving during this time. I owe them great gratitude.
